### Simple abstract

When you make a decision, your brain crosses a *decision boundary*. In the language of dynamical systems, this boundary is called a *separatrix* in the system's *phase space*, because states on either side of it proceed to evolve very differently, ultimately converging to different *attractors*. We develop a numerical method based on Koopman theory to charaterise this boundary, provided the dynamical function, i.e., a complete description of the system dynamics.  We demonstrate our method on several synthetic examples, trained RNNs and a model of microbiome ecology fit to experimental data. We demonstrate the method's utility in designing optimal perturbations to push a system across its separatrix.
