### Simple abstract

When you make a decision, your brain crosses a *decision boundary*. In dynamical systems language, this manifold of states is called a *separatrix* in it's *phase space* because states on either side of this manifold proceed to evolve very differently. We develop a numerical method based on Koopman theory to charaterise such a manifold provided the dynamical function, i.e., a comlete description of the dynamics.  We demonstrate the method on several synthetic examples, trained RNNs and a model of microbiome ecology fit to experimental data.
